Dear team of AI NOW
Institute, 

 



My name is Daira Pinto Prieto and I would like to introduce myself and
explain why I am applying for the program associate position. I knew AI NOW
by reading an interview to Kate Crawford about the discrimination caused by artificial
intelligence. It seemed to me that she was showing an as real as ignored trouble and I started to look for more
information about your work. Casually, I found the perfect chance for me to
form part of this innovating project.  



I am especially interested in that vacancy
because of three reasons. First of them is that I could contribute actively and
effectively to minimize social inequality. I have been concerned about the
disparity of our society for many years and I think this project have real
possibilities to change the balance since it is not about reversing something
built during centuries but about developing an incipient technology without
bias directly.  Of course, there are
other ways to promote equality, but this has the particularity that it is a
professional challenge apart from a personal one. Finally, I think program
associate is a good position for me because it allows me to learn and develop
skills from a large variety of areas. This could be a great option for someone
who is starting their career as I am. 



In addition, I have some experiences that can be relevant for the profile according to
its description. For example, working as data analyst at HHRR department of Grupo Tragsa, I have guided a statistical project about
performance appraisals and bias caused by evaluatorsâ€™ subjectivity.  These tasks have given me practice in taking
responsibilities, proposing solutions and meet deadlines efficiently. Furthermore, I have passed from
studying and teaching mathematics to collaborate hand to hand with HHRR
technicians. This change has showed me that I am able to adjust myself to
diverse environments and requirements. On the other hand, studying mathematics
have allowed me for thinking in a structured and abstract way, as well as for
being in contact with research process during the B.Sc. thesis; administrate grants and organizing talks for our
student association;
and motivating and encouraging students when I worked as a teacher. 



As a last point, I
would like to say why I think this opportunity is a good step on my career.
Right now, I am interested in knowing the world and getting different
experiences related with my inquietudes. Nevertheless, my goal within several
years is to study a PhD in mathematics. My favorite branches are logic and set
theory, but I would like to be particularly motivated with a plan before trying
to enroll in a PhD program. I think that form part of AI NOW will give me not only the opportunity of work in a global impacting
project but the possibility of find a question I would like to answer in a
doctoral research.   



In summary, I hope to have transmitted that I
am a determined person, who feels really like to learn and work hard and who
wants to growth personal and professionally, to form part of a leading-edge
mission and to contribute to make fairer our world. 



Thank you very much for your time. 



 



Yours sincerely,



 Daira Pinto Prieto
